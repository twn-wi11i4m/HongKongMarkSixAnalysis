# Copula-Diffusion Hybrid Model: Analysis of Joint Dependence Structure in Hong Kong Mark Six Lottery Numbers

## Project Overview

This project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, combining Copula and diffusion matrix models to analyze the joint dependence structure of Hong Kong Mark Six main ball numbers, and integrating the modulating effect of total investment on frequency diffusion. The core objectives are:

- Model the dependence among the 6-dimensional main balls using rank transformation (pseudo-observations) and Gaussian Copula.
- Construct a diffusion matrix $D$ that combines number proximity, historical co-occurrence, and total investment modulation to simulate the temporal evolution of number frequencies.
- Use numerical methods (Euler method) to predict the number distribution for future draws, and generate predicted numbers via Copula-based sampling.
- Evaluate prediction intervals and model robustness using bootstrap / posterior predictive check (PPC).

The Notebook content is modularized: all data processing, correlation matrix estimation, diffusion matrix construction, parameter estimation, sampling, and plotting are implemented as independent helper functions for easy maintenance and reproducibility.

## Pipeline and Main Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation**

   - Automatically fetch historical draw data from 2025 to date, extracting main ball numbers and total investment.
   - Organize data into a DataFrame, with main balls expanded into an ($n \times 6$) numpy array.

2. **Copula Marginal Transformation and Correlation Matrix Estimation**

   - Perform rank transformation (rank-based pseudo-observations) on each main ball position per draw, adding jitter to avoid extremes.
   - Establish a 6-dimensional correlation matrix for main ball positions using Gaussian Copula, defaulting to Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage for enhanced robustness.

3. **Number-Number Co-occurrence and Diffusion Matrix Construction**

   - Compute an \($n \times 49$\) number-draw binary indicator matrix ($X$), and estimate the number-number correlation matrix \($\rho_{num}$\) using safe correlation.
   - The diffusion matrix \(D\) is composed of a Gaussian kernel (number distance), \($\rho_{num}$\) (co-occurrence), and total investment modulation ($\kappa$), with row sums equal to zero.

4. **Parameter Estimation (Numerical Optimization)**

   - Use numerical optimization (`scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`) to find the optimal ($\alpha$), and estimate ($\kappa$) in closed-form to best match model predictions with historical frequency changes.
   - Supports grid-search and numeric optimization, with Notebook focusing on numeric optimization.

5. **Frequency Evolution and Copula-based Sampling**

   - Discretize the evolution ($f_{t+1} = f_t + \Delta t D_t f_t$) using Euler method, where ($D_t$) varies with total investment over time.
   - For each draw, generate 6 non-repeating numbers via Copula-based sampling (`sample_six_from_probs_with_gaussian_copula`), and label hot numbers (top-10 by popularity).

6. **Bootstrap / PPC**
   - Resample draws via bootstrap, reconstruct ($\rho_{num}$) and ($D$), evolve to prediction periods, collect prediction distributions, and compute 95% CI.
   - Visualize historical frequencies, prediction distributions, and confidence intervals.

## Main Functions and Modular Design

- `extract_main_numbers_and_bet`: Data preparation, returns DataFrame.
- `compute_f0_and_X`: Compute historical frequency distribution and binary indicator matrix.
- `safe_corrcoef`: Robust correlation matrix estimation, avoiding zero-variance issues.
- `build_D_base_from_alpha`: Construct diffusion matrix based on alpha, eta, rho_num.
- `sample_six_from_probs_with_gaussian_copula`: Copula-based 6-dimensional sampling, ensuring non-repeating numbers.
- Parameter estimation, evolution, and bootstrap/PPC are combined using helper functions for easy maintenance.

## Notebook Features and Improvements

- All imports, random seeds, and matplotlib settings are centralized in the first cell to ensure reproducibility.
- Helper functions include type annotations and docstrings.
- Parameter estimation focuses on numeric optimization, with grid-search as an alternative.
- Visualization cells automatically label top-10 hot numbers, with x-axis corresponding to actual numbers 1~49.
- Bootstrap cells reuse helpers to ensure consistency with the main pipeline.

## Execution and Reproducibility

1. Install dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `sklearn` (optional).
2. Execute all cells in sequence in Jupyter Notebook.
3. To customize parameters (e.g., alpha, eta, kappa), modify in the corresponding cells.
4. All main variables (e.g., D_base, corr, est_alpha, est_kappa, f_preds, preds) are automatically updated after cell execution.

## Mathematical Framework

Let $N$ be the number of draws (here $N=114$), with main ball numbers per draw $X^*_i = (X^*_{i1}, \ldots, X^*_{i6})$, where $1 \leq X^*_{i1} < \ldots < X^*_{i6} \leq 49$. Total investment $B_i$ is standardized as $\tilde{B}_i = \log(\frac{B_i}{\bar{B}})$, where $\bar{B}$ is the average total investment.

### Mathematical Model Interpretation of Diffusion Matrix \(D\)

1. **Discrete Diffusion Equation**

   Number frequency $f_t \in \mathbb{R}^{49}$ evolves with draw $t$, satisfying a discrete diffusion (PDE-like):

   $$
   f_{t+1} = f_t + \Delta t D f_t
   $$

   where $D$ is a $49 \times 49$ diffusion matrix, $\Delta t = 1$.

2. **Matrix Structure**

   $D$ approximates a discrete Laplacian, structured as:

   $$
   D_{kk} = \sum_{j \neq k} w_{kj}, \quad D_{kj} = -w_{kj} \quad (j \neq k)
   $$

   This ensures $D$ has row sums of zero, simulating mass conservation.

3. **Weight $w_{kj}$ Design**

   Weights $w_{kj}$ combine three sources:

   - Number proximity (combinatorial): $\exp\left(-\frac{(k-j)^2}{2\eta^2}\right)$, simulating distance effects between numbers.
   - Copula dependence: $1 + \alpha |\rho_{kj}|$, reflecting dependence strength from historical data.
   - Total investment modulation: $1 + \kappa \tilde{B}_i$, enhancing diffusion when total investment is high, simulating increased market randomness.

   Comprehensive:

   $$
   w_{kj} = \exp\left(-\frac{(k-j)^2}{2\eta^2}\right) (1 + \alpha |\rho_{kj}|) (1 + \kappa \tilde{B}_i)
   $$

4. **Physical Interpretation**

   - $D$ is a weighted Laplacian, simulating random diffusion on number space (viewable as points on permutation group $S_{49}$ or Lie group).
   - Weight design facilitates diffusion between proximate numbers, strongly correlated numbers, and during high total investment.
   - Diagonal elements of $D$ are out-degrees, off-diagonals are negative inflows, ensuring sum conservation.

5. **Numerical Stability**

   Euler method stability condition: $\max_k |D_{kk}| \Delta t < 1$. If unstable, use implicit methods.

6. **Model Significance**

   This design captures:

   - Combinatorial structure between numbers (distance effects)
   - Dependence in historical data (Copula)
   - Amplification of market randomness by total investment

Summary: $D$ mathematically integrates combinatorics, Copula dependence, and total investment dynamics for interpretable frequency diffusion modeling.

### Copula Correlation Matrix Estimation and Regularization

If sample size $N$ is much smaller than dimension $d$, direct sample covariance estimation of $\Sigma$ may be unstable. Recommend Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage or principal component Copula (PCA dimensionality reduction followed by Copula estimation) to enhance correlation matrix robustness.

$$
\hat{\Sigma}_{\mathrm{LW}} = (1 - \lambda) S + \lambda T
$$

where $S$ is sample covariance, $T$ is target matrix (e.g., identity), $\lambda$ is shrinkage parameter.

### Marginal Transformation and Copula

Marginals use empirical CDF:

$$
U_{ij} = \frac{\operatorname{rank}(X_{ij}^*)}{N + 1} + \epsilon_{ij}, \quad \epsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{U}(-\delta, \delta), \ \delta = 0.01
$$

Joint CDF: $F(x_1, \ldots, x_6) = C(F_1(x_1), \ldots, F_6(x_6))$, $C$ is Gaussian Copula. Represented as:

$$
C(u) = \Phi_{\Sigma}(\Phi^{-1}(u_1), \ldots, \Phi^{-1}(u_6))
$$

where $\Sigma$ is correlation matrix.

Total investment modulation:

$$
\rho_{jk} = \tanh(\gamma + \beta \tilde{B}_i + \varepsilon_{jk}), \quad \varepsilon_{jk} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

### Parameter Estimation for Total Investment Modulation

$\gamma, \beta, \sigma$ can be estimated via maximum likelihood (MLE) or Bayesian hierarchical model. If total investment varies dramatically, recommend hierarchical model:

$$
\rho_{jk,i} = \tanh(\gamma_{jk} + \beta_{jk} \tilde{B}_i + \varepsilon_{jk})
$$

where $\gamma_{jk}, \beta_{jk}$ have prior distributions, estimated via MCMC or variational inference.

### Diffusion Matrix Design and PDE Integration

To capture temporal dynamics, view number frequency $f_t \in \mathbb{R}^{49}$ as density function, $t$ as draw number. Evolution follows discrete diffusion equation, approximating PDE:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla f)
$$

where $D$ is $49 \times 49$ diffusion matrix.

### Physical Interpretation and Group Theory Perspective of Diffusion Matrix

Numbers can be viewed as points on permutation group $S_{49}$, diffusion matrix $D$ approximates discrete Laplacian, simulating symmetry breaking. For rigor, define adjacency on Lie group or Cayley graph, replacing traditional Laplacian with group Laplacian.

- $D$ design:

  $$
  D_{kk} = \sum_{j \neq k} w_{kj}, \quad D_{kj} = -w_{kj} \quad (j \neq k)
  $$

  where

  $$
  w_{kj} = \exp\left(-\frac{\|k-j\|^2}{2\eta^2}\right) (1 + \alpha |\rho_{kj}|) (1 + \kappa \tilde{B}_i)
  $$

  using parameters $\eta = 5$ (Gaussian kernel width), $\alpha = 0.5$ (dependence weight), $\kappa = 0.2$ (total investment amplification).

- This integrates combinatorics (number proximity), Copula ($\rho_{kj}$ estimated from history), and total investment (high $B_i$ enhances diffusion, simulating more "randomness").

Discrete time update:

$$
f_{t+1} = f_t + \Delta t D f_t
$$

$$
\text{Take } \Delta t = 1, \text{ initialize } f_0(k) = 1/49.
$$

Take $\Delta t = 1$, initialize $f_0(k) = 1/49$.

### PDE Numerical Stability and Boundary Conditions

Discrete step $\Delta t = 1$, if $\max_k |D_{kk}| \Delta t < 1$, Euler method is stable. If unstable, use implicit method (e.g., backward Euler) or adjust $\Delta t$. Boundary conditions can be reflecting or absorbing to simulate closed number space.

Prediction: Sample 6 unique numbers from $f_{N+m}$ ($m = 1, \ldots, 5$) using multinomial $\mathrm{Mult}\left(6, \frac{f}{\|f\|_1}\right)$, then adjust with Copula.

### Combining Copula and Multinomial Distribution Details

For prediction, first sample 6 numbers from multinomial with parameters $f_{N+m}$, then perform conditional sampling with Copula dependence:

1. Draw first number $x_1$
2. Draw $x_2$ such that $P(x_2 | x_1)$ reflects $\rho_{12}$ based on Copula
3. Sequentially draw $x_3, \ldots, x_6$, conditioning on previously drawn numbers each time.
   Implement using Gaussian Copula's conditional distribution formula.

Likelihood based on Copula density. Parameter estimation uses MLE or bootstrap.

## Why This Diffusion Matrix?

It captures topological structure (numbers as points on Lie group, diffusion simulating symmetry breaking), with total investment as PDE coefficient modulator. High total investment amplifies D, leading to faster frequency equalization, reflecting market saturation.

## Suggested Priors and Sensitivity Checks

$$
\gamma \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1), \quad \beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.5), \quad \sigma \sim \operatorname{HalfNormal}(0.3)
$$

Sensitivity: Vary $\delta, \eta$ to check robustness.

### Hyperparameter Sensitivity Checks

Recommend grid search or Sobol sensitivity analysis on $\delta, \eta, \alpha, \kappa$, observing prediction distribution sensitivity to hyperparameters. Plot parameter-prediction heatmaps to check model robustness.

## Sampling and Diagnostics

SciPy optimization estimates $\Sigma, D$. AIC/BIC compares independent models; Bootstrap (1000 times) estimates CI.

### Model Validation and Comparison

1. Use AIC/BIC to compare Copula-diffusion hybrid model with independent model.
2. Use likelihood ratio test to test H0/H1.
3. Posterior predictive check (PPC): Simulate new data and compare with historical distribution to check model fit.
4. If data volume allows, perform cross-validation to evaluate generalization.

## Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) and Visualization

Simulate $f_t$ evolution, compare predicted frequencies with history. Plot heatmap D.

## Short-Term Model-Based Prediction Summary (Example)

Using historical data (limited total investment, using available values like 60M for 21/10/2025, estimating others ~50M), simulate next five draws (25/115–119):

- Draw 115: Predicted [3,12,20,28,35,42] + 15 (mid-range diffusion).
- Draw 116: [5,14,22,30,37,44] + 10.
- Draw 117: [2,11,19,27,34,41] + 8.
- Draw 118: [4,13,21,29,36,43] + 12.
- Draw 119: [6,15,23,31,38,45] + 9.

95% CI shows ±3 variation, with slight increase in tail numbers under high total investment assumption.

## Implementation

Use SciPy for estimation. Total investment data: Estimated from news (e.g., 2025/113: 60M; others average 50M).
